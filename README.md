# easygrid
*Easygrid* running with Grails Version 3.x

This is a fork of the https://github.com/tudor-malene/Easygrid *Easygrid* for Grails vers. <3.x

Be aware that we are using the *jgGrid* implementation of the *Easygrid* which is also the better tested part of this plugin.

Properly rebased *Pull requests* are always welcome!
